# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning models to predict stock prices based on historical stock data. It includes the process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation to predict future stock prices.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load historical stock data, clean, and preprocess the data for modeling.
- **Feature Selection and Extraction**: Select and engineer relevant features from the dataset for prediction models.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models to predict stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using different evaluation metrics.
- **Stock Price Visualization**: Visualize the actual vs predicted stock prices using graphs.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
